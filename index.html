                this could be a snide reference
                to <em>zugot</em>, a period of time (170 BCE - 30 CE) where Jews had pairs of religious
                leaders. Cross reference to
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%2011%3A28-29&version=NIV">Matthew 11:28-29</a>.
                According to Cultural Backgrounds Study Bible, Jewish teachers believed that the law could
                "[free] them from heavier burdens".

              I suspect you would never intend this, but this is what happens. When you attempt to live by
              your own religious plans and projects, you are cut off from Christ, you fall out of grace.
              Meanwhile we expectantly wait for a satisfying relationship with the Spirit. For in Christ,
              neither our most conscientious religion nor disregard of religion amounts to anything. What
              matters is something far more interior: <span class="repeating faith">faith</span> expressed

              <u>閹割</u>: Greek <i>apokopsontai</i>; to cut off. There are 2 schools of thought:
              physically cutting off (mutilate, emancipate), or spiritually cutting off (excommunicate).
              In Martin Luther's (translated) commentary, he doesn't place importance on which school of
              thought is correct. In fact, he places more emphasis on the curse that Paul utters, and what
              circumstances where Christian cursing is acceptible. He concludes that this type of cursing
              is "the gift of the Holy Ghost". <sup><a href="#luther-1" id="footnote-5">[6]</a></sup> And
              we see that he is correct. There are many places where cursing is used in the Bible.

              To the Gentiles, circumcision was equivalent to mutilation.
